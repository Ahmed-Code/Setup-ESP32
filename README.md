# Setup-ESP32
## in this repository i will explain how can setup ESP32 and use it

- first of all we will download Ardino IDE , for we can write program code on ESP32.

- then plug in the ESP32 to the computer.

- and for setup ESP32 with the IDE we need library , so we should go to `File > Prefrencec`  then write " https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json " on Additional boards Manger URLs.

- then i go to  `tools > Board: "Arduino Uno" > Boards Manger` and install the ESP32.

- then i select the board from `tools > Board: "Arduino Uno" > ESP32 Arduino > WEMOS D1 MINI ESP32`. 

- then i try to test by choosing an example from `File > Examples > ESP32`.
